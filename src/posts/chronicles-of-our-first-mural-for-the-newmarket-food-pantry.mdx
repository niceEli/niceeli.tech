I made a mural for newmarket pantry. The vision for the mural that me and a few friends made was to show that anyone can get food. We also made the mural to look good and i think we did a great job on that.

During the collaborative phase of our art we had some roadblocks suck as how most of the shapes in our adobe file had holes in it. However I think it turned out great.
