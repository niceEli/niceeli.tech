[The Late Movie on YouTube](https://youtu.be/SBhGsfMhyPY)

My experience with filming was a rough time because there was little to no planning done by the director. The planning for the film was not the best as our script was half-baked.

The script that was created was difficult to understand and was not very descriptive about the scenes, often leading to guessing, which can cause arguments. There was another problem with the director treating everyone as his servant.

The director often forced changes from the editor at the last minute (honestly sounds like a PM[1]) and it was always his way or no way. Other than those experiences it was good and I'm glad how it turned out. If you want to watch the movie I'm going to upload it to YouTube and the link will be uploaded soon as another post. Be warned about the movie though as it is a horror movie so viewer discretion is advised (also epilepsy warning).

*EDIT the movie is now at the top of this post.
