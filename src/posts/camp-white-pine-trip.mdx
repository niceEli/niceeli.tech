![Camp White Pine](/content/camp-white-pine-trip/CWP.webp)

My trip to Camp White Pine was alright. The food at CWP was mainly powdered food meaning, the eggs, milk, and orange juice all tasted like water since it was powdered. The cabins (as you see above) have no walls, so basically I'm sleeping in a plywood box. The activities were really fun as they did team building, and doing things with friends is really fun, I really enjoyed climbing the 10ft wall. Bunking with friends was fun and luckily this time there was no one who was knocking on the door. With that, Ill say that CWP was great.
