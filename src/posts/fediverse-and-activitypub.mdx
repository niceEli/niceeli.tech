# <u>niceEli.tech Has Been Transitioned From Wordpress To NextJS, Information In This Article May Be Incorrect</u>

my site niceEli.tech now uses ActivityPub and in turn the Fediverse. this is because Iâ€™m using permalinks now because i made my own landing page. before permalinks broke my landing page, now i dont use a landing page by WP so this is a good day rn.

My main fediverse profile is [@niceEli](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@niceEli)
