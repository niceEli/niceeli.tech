My experience with art is very great. Within my class I have met many people and made many friends, I even made some things like this website.

I also painted a painting for the Newmarket Pantry for one of my assignments. in this Assignment, we needed to design a painting that would be relevant, draw it in illustrator, and finally paint it on a giant canvas. Another thing I did was an experiment with hosting a server, this wasnâ€™t part of the course, however, it was necessary for running this website and the new API for some of my games. Honestly, I recommend anyone who is able to, take an ALC or iRAP course, it is worth it.
